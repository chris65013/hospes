**Latin for Hospital.**

Project 4 repository for University of Calgary - ENGO 551 - Winter 2020 by Chris Lin

### Main Features of the project
* A interactable map via **Mapbox** and **Turf.js** to find the closest medical facility of an education institution.
* Pop-ups that shows the name of the place
* 13000 lines because I, and I cannot stress this enough, smart enough to figure out how to use external geojson files
** Note that you only need main.html, there's no need to download anything else
